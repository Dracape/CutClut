[AdBlock filter](https://adguard.com/en/blog/what-are-filters.html "What are AdBlock filters") that
- Removes
  - Premium content ads
  - Privacy policies
  - Donations
  - Repetative elements
    - Unrelated elements already available with a minimalistic approach
  - Light-themed background media spoiling the forced-dark themes
- Blocks ugly fake/unofficial websites with ADs and trackers
- Attempts to bypass bot verifications

# Important information

## Some websites will never be added
[Websites with front-ends][Frontends] that remove all the clutter will not be accepted, but you can request the [front-end websites][Frontends]
### Exceptions
- The front-end doesn't have some functionality (for the end-user) present in the original website
- The front-end is uglier than the original website
## Work in progress
CutClut currently covers very few websites.
You can create a [pull request](https://github.com/Dracape/CutClut/pulls "Pull requests of 'CutClut'") or a [*site request* issue](https://github.com/Dracape/CutClut/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Site+request&projects=&template=site-request.md&title= "Create an issue to add a new site") for more!
